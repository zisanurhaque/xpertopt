        "Did you know that Amazon won’t process a reimbursement unless claimed by the seller? Most automated refunds and reimbursements do not cover all damages to your inventory. There are many reasons you might not be getting what Amazon owes you. Our team of Amazon experts carefully inspects possible issues and cases where you might be eligible for reimbursements. Our team will contact Amazon and open a new case for you so you can sit back, relax, and focus on growing your business.",

        "When you sign up with us, our refund experts scans your account and run manual checks. We evaluate your last 18 months’ data and raise FBA inventory reimbursement requests to Seller Central support. Not only that, but we also audit your entire Amazon seller account to see if you are overcharged with any Amazon fees (such as listing fees due to incorrect categorization or updates to your product weight and dimensions).",

        "Seller Interactive understands the importance of time. That’s why we believe sellers shouldn’t spend valuable hours just reviewing their accounts. We are here to help you get your money back so you can focus on what matters. Reach out to us now to find out more."
